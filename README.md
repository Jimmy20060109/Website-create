# ⚛️ React Learning Projects

This folder contains my personal React learning playground.  
While following courses and documentation, I built several small projects to practice modern React (functional components, hooks, and state management) and front‑end tooling.

## 📂 What’s Inside

- `animals/` – A small app to practice React state:
  - Add random animal cards and “like” them
  - Each card manages its own likes and heart size
  - Focus on `useState`, event handlers, and immutable updates

- `books/` – A minimal books manager:
  - Add, edit, and list books in a clean UI
  - React + Vite setup with ESLint
  - Ready to connect to a mock API (e.g. JSON Server)

- `note_project/` – A simple notes app (WIP/experiments):
  - Practice CRUD patterns and component composition
  - Experiment with React project structure and build tools

- `jsx/`, `pdas/`, `react-starter-project@0.0.0/`, `vite/`:
  - Sandboxes for trying out JSX, basic components, and Vite tooling

## 🎯 What I’m Practicing

- Writing React 18/19 functional components with hooks (`useState`, etc.)
- Managing list and form state in a predictable, immutable way
- Structuring small apps into reusable components
- Working with modern tooling: Vite, npm scripts, ESLint

## 🚀 How to Run Any Project

1. `cd` into a project folder (for example: `cd react/books`)
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
